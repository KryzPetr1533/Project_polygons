# Project_polygons
##### Introduction
This is a project I developed in 10-th grade. It was one of the tasks students have to do in Lyceum 1533. It's not much, but a fair work.

##### Instruction
To open the project you have to:
 1. Install all of the files from repository
 2. Open file "Project Shape.exe"

##### Description
The main object in the program is one of the figures: triangle, circle, square.
User can
 -create a figure by LMB click on clean area
 -drag&drop figures
 -delete a figure by RMB click on the figure
When user create more than 2 figures a shell appears covering all figures. User can drag&drop the whole shell by LMB click. Any figure inside the shell will be deleted.
