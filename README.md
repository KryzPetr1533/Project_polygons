# Project_polygons
#### Introduction
This is a project I developed in 10-th grade. It was one of the tasks students have to do in Lyceum 1533. It's not much, but a fair work.

#### Instruction
To open the project you have to:
 1. Install all of the files from repository
 2. Open file "Project Shape.exe"

#### Description
The main object in the program is one of the figures: triangle, circle, square.
User can
 -create a figure by LMB click on clean area
 -drag&drop figures
 -delete a figure by RMB click on the figure
When user create more than 2 figures a shell appears covering all figures. User can drag&drop the whole shell by LMB click. Any figure inside the shell will be deleted.
##### Menu bar
There are 3 tool bars in the menu bar.
By clicking on "Файл" user can see 3 options:
 -"Сохранить как" allows saving file on the device
 -"Сохранить" updates already saved file. If file was not saved before, it works the same as "Сохранить как"
 -"Загрузить" opens already saved file
By clicking on "Выбор вершины" user can change the shape of the next figure. "Треугольник" switches shape to triangle, "Круг" to circle and "Квадрат" to square.
Switching the shape does not affect already created objects.
By clicking on "Опции" user can change color and size of the figures. Option "Изменение радиуса" is for the size and "Изменение цвета" is for the color.
